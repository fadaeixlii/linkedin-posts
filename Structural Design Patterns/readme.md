## **Structural Design Patterns**

Structural patterns are all about organizing and structuring classes or objects to create larger, flexible, and maintainable software systems. Letâ€™s dive into some popular structural patterns with real-world examples and their advantages.

### **1. Adapter Pattern**

The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.

#### **Real-World Example**

Imagine your app interacts with an API that sends data in XML, but the processing API only accepts JSON. You need an adapter to convert XML to JSON before sending the data.

In code terms, suppose you have an array of cities with populations in millions. A new city has raw population data, and you need to adapt its format before adding it to the array:

```javascript
const citiesHabitantsInMillions = [
  { city: "London", habitants: 8.9 },
  { city: "Rome", habitants: 2.8 },
];

const BuenosAires = { city: "Buenos Aires", habitants: 3100000 };

const toMillionsAdapter = (city) => {
  city.habitants = parseFloat((city.habitants / 1_000_000).toFixed(1));
};

toMillionsAdapter(BuenosAires);
citiesHabitantsInMillions.push(BuenosAires);
```

#### **Advantage**

It makes incompatible systems work seamlessly together without changing their existing code.

### **2. Decorator Pattern**

The Decorator pattern dynamically adds behavior to an object without altering its structure.

#### **Real-World Example**

If youâ€™ve used Reactâ€™s Context API or Higher-Order Components (HOCs), youâ€™ve already encountered this. A Context Provider acts as a wrapper, dynamically adding shared state or functionality to components.

```javascript
const ContextProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  return (
    <Context.Provider value={{ darkMode, setDarkMode }}>
      {children}
    </Context.Provider>
  );
};
```

#### **Advantage**

It provides flexibility by enabling additional features without modifying the core object, fostering modularity.

### **3. Facade Pattern**

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

#### **Real-World Example**

Libraries like Material-UI (MUI) are great examples. Instead of dealing with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can quickly build UI components with pre-built abstractions:

```javascript
import Table from "@mui/material/Table";

export default function App() {
  return <Table>{/* Simplified Table structure */}</Table>;
}
```

#### **Advantage**

It hides complexity, making the system easier to use and understand.

### **4. Proxy Pattern**

The Proxy pattern provides a placeholder or intermediary to control access to another object.

#### **Real-World Example**

Express.js middlewares act as proxies. For instance, an authentication middleware ensures only authenticated users access specific endpoints:

```javascript
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send("Token required");
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.TOKEN_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.status(403).send("Invalid token");
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};
```

This middleware acts as a proxy to validate the request before proceeding.

#### **Advantage**

Proxies improve security, logging, caching, and resource control by acting as gatekeepers.
